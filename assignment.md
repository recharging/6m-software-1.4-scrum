## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. In your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
As their startup IT consultant, I need to develop a high-level technology roadmap to align with the enterprise business strategy. Technology initiatives must be defined to directly support or align with business objectives. The technology roadmap shows the concrete costs and time needed for the initiatives to steer towards the desired state. 

Scrum methodology is recommended to transform the technology roadmap of startups into time-boxed discretised blocks. The technology goals can be mapped into the chief artifacts of Scrum, namely: product backlog, Sprint backlog and product increment. 

Product backlogs are functional and non-functional requirements of hardware and software to be fulfilled. For example, cloud or on-site hosting architecture, monolith or containerised, in order to achieve a desired latency, performance and security model. The product owner (usually business user) is held accountable for the capture of business value from fulfilment of product backlogs.

Sprint Goals lasting 4-weeks are derived through consensus between the product owner and developers. Sprint backlogs are generated from the prioritisation of Product backlog and Sprint Goals. A Scrum Master removes impediments to Sprint Goals in an adhoc or structured manner. A 15-minute Daily Scrum holds members accountable to the backlog list, and allows for backlog adjustment. A Sprint Review and Retrospective closes off the Sprint Goal and collates important lessons learned. 

Product Increments can be declared upon completion of the Sprint Goals. These increments may be considered for release into production to capture the intended business value.

The use of Scrum methodology improves productivity by facilitating achievable, accountable goals that are mutually agreed upon by the business user (product owner) and the developers. This accountability for productivity, compared to other Agile methods, is particularly suited for start-up growth and operations as the timelines are short, trackable and achievable for start-up objectives that pivot frequently.

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1. As a regular borrower of physical books, I want to report on the condition of physical books, so that previous borrowers can be held accountable and they can be taken out of cirulation on the onset of severe damage.
2. As a reader of e-books, I want to browse, borrow and return licenced e-books on a single page, so that I manage my reading pipeline with minimum web application navigation.
3. As a payer of late/reservation/delivery/damage fees, I want to link my e-wallet, credit card, digital payment routes to the credit wallet of the library, so that I can make secure and timely payments for the physical and electronic services provided by the library.
4. As a self-improvement learner, I want to be offered recommendations for existing and make recommendations for new books, so that I can benefit from and increase the body of knowledge available in the public library.
5. As a parent of young children, I want to organise pre-packed and curated age-appropriate books for collection at the library, so that I can reduce my time spent at the library that will impact the children's nap schedules. 
6. As a student researcher for school projects, I want to be allocated sufficient books in a timely fashion in line with the Ministry of Education's research homework schedule, so that I will not be left without reference materials when the other 40,000 school children are doing the same project.
7. As a travel enthusiast, I want to reserve for physical borrowing travel magazines and guide books that are tied to online review sites and travel blogs, so that I can plan my reference materials well in advance of my travel plans.
8. As a nature lover, I want to browse books which have pages/paragraphs geotagged to the flora and fauna of a particular region, e.g. Peninsular Malaysia, so that I do not have to search  
9. As a digital musician, I want to be able to borrow scores using tune-recognition functionalities, so that I can identify and read obscure music pieces that are impactful yet rare.
10. As an AI practitioner, I want the library to have sufficient content licenced for input into Large Language Models, so that I can use a chatbot to access information that would otherwise require intensive research.
